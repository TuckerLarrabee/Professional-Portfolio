                <p>
                    My name is Tucker Larrabee and I was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. I attended The Darla Moore School of Business at The University of South Carolina (Forever to thee!) and graduated in 2017. I began my professional career as a Business Analyst consulting for Duck Creek software. This immersed me in the tech world, and ever since starting out as a BA, I have always been intrigued by programming. Working directly with developers day in and day out, I was exposed to some programming languages such as HTML and XML. More than anything though, working as a Business Analyst taught me the functional side of the Software Development Life Cycle.
